title: The AI Loop
description: The end-to-end label-driven pipeline that turns an ai-ready GitHub issue into a reviewed PR — the one constraint that shapes it, the label state machine, the repo prerequisites, and the limits that keep it cheap.
---

`ai-loop` is a **label-driven pipeline** that takes a GitHub issue marked
`ai-ready`, implements it in a per-issue git worktree, opens a PR, has two agents
review it, and hands it to you to merge. It runs unattended on a timer.

`repo-ai` ships the skill and its `loop` commands. The repo-side pieces it
relies on — the branch-protection standard and the `.claude/settings.json`
worktree config — come from [`@rtorcato/repo-tooling`](https://github.com/rtorcato/repo-tooling).

:::warning

**Costs and liability.** By installing or using repo-ai, you accept these risks and responsibilities. repo-ai runs AI agents unattended, and they spend your Anthropic credits or plan limits and your GitHub Actions minutes. The loop's limits are best-effort, not a spending guarantee. Set spend limits with your provider, and stop the loop when you aren't watching it. Agents can be wrong, so you review and merge every change. Provided as is under the MIT license, with no warranty; the authors aren't liable for costs, damages or changes made by agents.

:::

## Install it

```bash
npx @rtorcato/repo-ai fix claude-skills
```

That writes `~/.claude/skills/ai-loop/SKILL.md`. Unlike every other fixer
this one writes **user-global** state — a directory shared by every project on
the machine — which is why it is **opt-in**: a bare `fix` or `fix --yes` skips
it and says so, and `doctor` reports it as *not configured* rather than as a
finding against your repo.

Four things follow from that:

- **`--skills-dir <path>`** overrides the destination. It is required alongside
  `--yes` / `--json` when `~/.claude/skills` does not exist, since a prompt
  would corrupt the JSON payload.
- **A stow-managed symlink is written *through*, not replaced.** If
  `~/.claude/skills/ai-loop/SKILL.md` is a symlink into a dotfiles
  checkout, the content lands in dotfiles and stays version-controlled with the
  rest of your Claude config. The CLI reports the resolved real path so you know
  what to commit.
- **The install refuses to downgrade.** Each installed copy carries a
  `repo-ai-version` stamp in its frontmatter. A repo pinned to an older
  release reports and skips rather than overwriting a newer skill — otherwise
  two repos on different versions would fight over it on every `fix`.
- **The install refuses to overwrite a local fork.** Alongside the version, each
  copy carries a `repo-ai-hash` of the content we wrote. If the installed
  file no longer matches that hash — or predates it, so nothing can be proven —
  the install prints what diverged and stops, the same rule
  [`fix copied-assets`](https://rtorcato.github.io/repo-tooling/docs/guides/cli) follows for copied presets. This is the case
  the version stamp alone cannot see: a fork that is merely *older* than the
  package looks exactly like a stale copy. Diff it against the shipped file the
  message names, then pass **`--force-skills`** to take the shipped version.
  `--yes` deliberately does *not* imply it: unattended runs pass `--yes`, and
  this is the one overwrite that destroys work living outside the repo.

Any agent that reads the [`skills`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/skills) CLI
format can also take it straight from GitHub:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/rtorcato/repo-ai --skill ai-loop
```

## Configuration

Per-repo settings live in `.repo-ai.json` at the repo root. Every key is
optional:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://rtorcato.github.io/repo-ai/repo-ai.json",
  "agentUser": "my-bot",
  "requiredSkills": ["ai-loop"]
}
```

| Key | Type | Default | Read by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `$schema` | string | none | Your editor, for completion and validation. `fix config` and `setup` write it. |
| `agentUser` | string | none: the loop runs as whoever `gh` is signed in as | `loop guard`, which halts a tick running as anyone else; `loop env`; `fix ai-loop-identity`; `doctor`. |
| `requiredSkills` | string[] | `[]`: no check | `doctor`, which reports any listed skill that is not installed. Checked only when `agentUser` is set. |
| `pollSeconds` | integer | `180`; values below `60` are raised to `60` | `loop watch`, between polls. Each poll costs several GitHub API calls against the 5,000/h limit. |
| `budgetTokens` | integer | `400000`; values below `1000` are ignored | `loop env` (as `BUDGET_TOKENS`), passed to the `ai-loop-pickup` and `ai-loop-pass3` Workflow scripts, which enforce it — an agent past the cap is skipped and `log()`ged, not spawned. |

The schema is [`schemas/repo-ai.json`](https://rtorcato.github.io/repo-ai/repo-ai.json)
(JSON Schema draft 2020-12), which ships in the npm package too. It sets
`additionalProperties: false`, so `doctor` reports a mistyped key as drift
rather than silently ignoring it. It also reports a wrong type, and a file that
is not valid JSON.

`npx @rtorcato/repo-ai fix config` adds `$schema` to an existing file. With no
file, it creates one, copying over any `agentUser` / `requiredSkills` still
held in the legacy `.repo-tooling.json` (`rules.aiLoop.agentUser`,
`rules.requiredSkills`). Without `.repo-ai.json` the loop falls back to that
legacy location, and `doctor` flags it as drift.

## The one constraint

By default every agent in the pipeline authenticates as **your own `gh`** — no
PATs, no bot account, nothing to set up. GitHub refuses `gh pr review --approve`
on your own PR, so under that default **a real GitHub approval is impossible.**
That is a consequence of the zero-setup choice, not a limit of GitHub — see
[Running reviewers as a second identity](#running-reviewers-as-a-second-identity)
below.

Two consequences, and both are load-bearing:

1. **Approval is a label**, not a review. `ai-ok-code` / `ai-ok-sec` record that
   an agent passed the diff, until the handoff replaces them with `merge-ready`.
2. **Required status checks stay the real merge gate.** Never set
   `required_pull_request_reviews` on the protected branch — required review
   deadlocks every PR the loop opens.

The same constraint means everything an agent posts *looks* hand-written by the
repo owner. So every comment an agent leaves opens with a `🤖 *Automated …*`
header naming which agent wrote it. A detailed security review under a human's
avatar misrepresents who reviewed the code.

### Running reviewers as a second identity

Give the reviewing agents their own GitHub account — a machine user invited as a
collaborator, or a GitHub App — and the reviewer is no longer the PR author, so
`--approve` works and the `ai-ok-*` labels stop being necessary. Keep the two
apart on the machine rather than switching profiles, so an agent can never act
as you by accident:

```bash
GH_CONFIG_DIR=~/.config/gh-bot gh auth login --web --scopes repo   # once, as the bot
GH_CONFIG_DIR=~/.config/gh-bot gh pr review 42 --approve           # runs as the bot
```

Complete the device flow in a private window logged in as the bot — your default
browser will authorise *you* instead, leaving two profiles holding one identity.

When `.repo-ai.json` declares `agentUser` (or the legacy `.repo-tooling.json`
`rules.aiLoop.agentUser`), `loop guard` halts any tick not running as that
account. `npx @rtorcato/repo-ai fix ai-loop-identity`
wires a checkout to it: it checks that `~/.config/gh-<agentUser>` (or
`--gh-config-dir <path>`) is signed in as the agent, then merges
`"env": {"GH_CONFIG_DIR": "<dir>"}` into the gitignored
`.claude/settings.local.json`. Relaunch Claude afterwards. **Every** session in
that checkout then runs as the agent, hands-on ones included — so use it on a
checkout dedicated to the loop. It is opt-in: a bare `fix --yes` never runs it.

#### Per session, with `GH_TOKEN`

If the bot is already signed in to `gh` alongside you (`gh auth login` a second
time, as the bot, adds it to the keyring), you can skip the separate config
directory and run just the loop's session as the bot:

```bash
GH_TOKEN=$(gh auth token --user <agentUser>) claude    # this session only
```

Then start the loop as usual (`/ai-loop`). `gh` and git pushes in that
session run as the bot; every other terminal stays you. To pick up an existing
conversation, add `--continue` or `--resume`.

Either way, first:

1. **Give the bot write access.** Invite it as a collaborator with `push`
   permission and accept the invite as the bot. Read access can't push branches
   or apply labels.
2. **Declare it.** Put `{"agentUser": "<agentUser>"}` in `.repo-ai.json`.

Once `agentUser` is set, a session running as anyone else halts every tick:

```
⚠ agentUser is <agentUser> but gh authenticates as <you> — the tick would commit, push and review as the wrong account. Run `npx @rtorcato/repo-ai fix ai-loop-identity` in this checkout, then relaunch the Claude session; or run just one session as the agent: `GH_TOKEN=$(gh auth token --user <agentUser>) claude`
```

That is the guard working. Restart the session as the bot, either for the whole
checkout or [per session](#per-session-with-gh_token), or remove `agentUser` to
go back to running as yourself. `loop watch` is the exception: it writes nothing
to GitHub, so it prints the warning once to stderr and keeps polling. The loop trusts only verdicts posted by its
own login, so after a switch, PRs already under review are reviewed again by
the new identity.

Be clear about what this buys, because it is easy to overstate:

- **Attribution** — agent reviews are visibly not you in every timeline, which no
  comment header can guarantee.
- **Scope** — a machine user's token reaches only the repos you invited it to.
- **Compatibility** — its approvals can satisfy branch protection wherever a real
  second party exists.

What it does **not** buy is a second reviewer. One agent system drives both
accounts, so making reviews *required* would let the pipeline satisfy its own
merge gate — two-party on paper, one-party in fact. Your merge decision stays the
only genuine second party either way, which is why the loop hands issue PRs to a
human regardless.

Two things to settle before relying on it. Repo-settings tooling — including this
package's own `fix github-settings` — asserts `required_pull_request_reviews:
null`, because required review deadlocks solo Dependabot auto-merge; it will
revert an approval rule on its next run unless you change that standard first.
And the shipped skill still records verdicts as labels, so today this is
groundwork rather than a supported mode
([#518](https://github.com/rtorcato/repo-tooling/issues/518) tracks the rewrite).

## Labels and the state machine

All state lives in GitHub labels. A tick is a stateless, idempotent pass over
that state, so a missed tick, a crash, or a restart costs nothing.

| Label | On | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `ai-ready` | issue | Eligible for an agent. The hard gate. |
| `ai-wip` | issue | Claimed; a worktree exists. |
| `ai-blocked` | issue | Agent gave up; needs a human. |
| `holding` | issue | A gate — closes on human judgement, never picked up. |
| `ai-review` | PR | Awaiting agent review. |
| `ai-reviewing-code` | PR | `code-reviewer` claimed and running. Cleared with its verdict. |
| `ai-reviewing-sec` | PR | `security-expert` claimed and running. Cleared with its verdict. |
| `ai-ok-code` | PR | `code-reviewer` passed. In-flight only — the handoff strips it. |
| `ai-ok-sec` | PR | `security-expert` passed. In-flight only — the handoff strips it. |
| `ai-changes` | PR | A reviewer requested changes, or Pass 1 sent the PR back: a required check failed, or the PR is `DIRTY` (conflicts) or `BLOCKED` by a ruleset. On a PR opened by hand, with no loop worktree, it waits for you instead of a fixer. |
| `ai-fixing` | PR | Fix-round implementer claimed and running. Cleared with its push. |
| `ai-notes` | PR | Passed, but a reviewer left something to read before merging. |
| `merge-ready` | PR | Both agent reviews passed and the PR is mergeable — waiting on a human. Supersedes the `ai-ok-*` pair rather than joining it. |
| `ai-suggested` | issue | A follow-up a reviewer filed. A triage queue: never picked up automatically. Add `ai-ready` to queue it; closed after 30 days untouched. |

### What you'll see on a PR

A PR moves through a few label combinations. Read them as "whose turn is it":

| Labels | What's happening | Whose turn |
|---|---|---|
| `ai-review` | Opened, waiting for reviewers to start | the loop |
| `ai-review` `ai-reviewing-code` `ai-reviewing-sec` | Both reviewers are running (a docs-only PR gets one combined reviewer that claims both) | the reviewers |
| `ai-review` `ai-ok-code` `ai-reviewing-sec` | Code review passed; security review still running (either order) | the reviewers |
| `ai-review` `ai-ok-code` `ai-ok-sec` | Both passed; waiting for CI to go green, or for the branch to be updated from `main` | the loop |
| `ai-changes` | A reviewer asked for a change, or CI failed | the loop (a fixer is next) |
| `ai-changes` `ai-fixing` | A fixer is pushing a fix; both reviews run again afterwards | the fixer |
| `merge-ready` | Reviewed, green, mergeable | **you** |
| `merge-ready` `ai-notes` | Same, but read the reviewer's `### Before merging` first | **you** |

A claim label (`ai-reviewing-*`, `ai-fixing`) that sits for 45 minutes means its agent died; the next tick clears it and starts over.

A PR handed over for you to merge therefore carries exactly one of two label
sets, and the difference is legible without opening anything:

| Labels | Means |
|---|---|
| `merge-ready` | Merge freely. |
| `merge-ready`, `ai-notes` | Passed, but open the comments first. |

`merge-ready` asserts strictly more than `ai-ok-code` + `ai-ok-sec` — both
reviews passed *and* GitHub reports the PR mergeable — so the handoff drops the
pair rather than stacking three labels that all say "passed".

Colours carry meaning here — `ai-ready` is green and `ai-blocked` red precisely
so the two states a maintainer must tell apart are legible at a glance. `doctor`
audits colour and description as the **`AI loop labels`** check, and `fix labels`
repairs drift with `gh label edit`. The distinction matters: the skill's
bootstrap block uses `gh label create`, which errors as a no-op on a label that
already exists — so it can add a missing label but can never repair a
hand-created one. A repo with fewer than two of these labels is reported as *not
applicable* rather than drift: not running the loop is a choice, and neither the
check nor the fixer pushes labels into a repo that opted out.

```
issue: ai-ready ─pickup─> ai-wip ─> PR opened, labelled ai-review
PR: ai-review ─> ai-reviewing-* ─┬─> ai-ok-code + ai-ok-sec ─┬─ issue PR  ─> merge-ready, assigned to you
                                 │        (± ai-notes)       │              ─> YOU merge
                                 │                           └─ dependabot ─> auto-merge
                                 └─> ai-changes ─> ai-fixing (max 2) ─> ai-review
                                     ▲                       └─ round 3 ─> ai-blocked
                                     └─ Pass 1 sends back: not CLEAN, or a required check FAILED
```

`ai-reviewing-code` / `ai-reviewing-sec` / `ai-fixing` are the claim step. Pass 3
applies one as it queues that agent for the tick's Workflow and skips queueing a
second while it is set, so a tick that fires mid-run cannot double-spawn; the agent
clears its own claim alongside the label it ends on — a verdict for a reviewer,
`ai-review` for the fix round. A duplicated fix round is the worse of the two:
both implementers share one worktree and one branch, so they race each other's
commits rather than merely posting two review comments.

`ai-changes` is the send-back — **never** re-apply `ai-ready` to an open PR's
issue; that is what double-picks it.

`ai-notes` is advisory and never blocks. It rides *alongside* a pass label, not
instead of one. It exists because a pass label otherwise means both "clean" and
"I found something real but would not hold the PR over it", and those two are
indistinguishable in the *Assigned to you* view where merges actually happen.
The bar is a finding that **changes whether or how a human should merge**: a
semver implication, a deliberate omission, a risky migration, a decision only a
human can make. An open question the reviewer couldn't settle from the diff is
not a finding — it settles it with a read-only check, or passes clean, or files
an `ai-suggested` issue when later work is needed. A note that concludes "no
action needed" is never written.
`ai-notes` on every PR is the failure mode — it trains the reader to ignore it.

## Repo prerequisites

```bash
npx @rtorcato/repo-tooling fix github-settings --yes
```

`GITHUB_STANDARD` already encodes exactly what the loop needs: squash as the
*only* merge method (Pass 2 finds the `(#N)` squash subject on `main` to confirm
work landed — a merge commit makes it look like nothing merged, and the worktree
leaks), auto-merge, delete-branch-on-merge, and `required_pull_request_reviews: null`
with a comment explaining that required review deadlocks auto-merge. You also
need **at least one required status check** — that is the gate doing the real
work.

Verify:

```bash
gh api repos/$OWNER_REPO --jq '{allow_squash_merge, allow_merge_commit, allow_rebase_merge, allow_auto_merge, delete_branch_on_merge}'
gh api repos/$OWNER_REPO/branches/main/protection \
  --jq '{contexts: .required_status_checks.contexts, reviews: .required_pull_request_reviews}'
```

Worktrees also want `node_modules` symlinked in, so an agent can typecheck
without a full install per issue. `fix ai` writes that list — the root plus every
workspace package — into `.claude/settings.json` as
`worktree.symlinkDirectories`, and Pass 4 reads it and creates the links itself.
Without it the loop still works: each worktree gets a real `pnpm install`
instead, which costs a duplicate `node_modules` per issue.

## The tick

Passes run cheapest first, so a quiet repo exits fast.

| Pass | Does |
|---|---|
| **0 — orient** | Resolve the main checkout, fetch, list open PRs and `ai-wip` issues. Adopt unlabelled PRs — Dependabot's, and any the loop's own identity opened with the `🤖` header. Bail to Pass 5 with `idle` only if there is nothing at all: no labelled PR, no eligible issue, and no leftover worktree. |
| **1 — merge** | Auto-merge only *Dependabot* PRs that passed both reviews. Hand every other ready PR to you as `merge-ready`, dropping `ai-review` and both `ai-ok-*`. Update a `BEHIND` branch with `gh pr update-branch`, keeping the reviews; wait on required checks still pending. Send back anything else GitHub reports as not `CLEAN`, or with a required check red. |
| **2 — clean up** | Remove worktrees whose PR merged (confirming the squash is on `main` first), then reap stalls. |
| **3 — review** | Queue the missing reviewers for `ai-review` PRs and a fix round for each `ai-changes` PR, then run them all in one Workflow (at most 8 agents) with typed verdicts. The agents still write the labels and verdict markers. |
| **4 — pick up** | Claim eligible `ai-ready` issues, create the worktrees, and run one Workflow: an implementer per issue, then two reviewers per PR. |
| **5 — report** | One-line summary, notify only when it changed. Never skipped, including on an idle tick. |

Three details worth knowing because they fail *silently* when got wrong:

- **Worktrees live in a sibling directory** (`<repo>-worktrees/`), never inside
  the repo. A worktree under `.claude/worktrees/` sits on a path most repos
  exclude from their own tooling — observed on a repo whose Biome config carried
  `"!**/.claude"`, where the pre-commit hook linted *nothing* in every agent
  worktree and failed with a message that read like a tooling glitch.
- **Implementers never enter their worktree** — they reach it through
  `git -C <absolute path>`. The worktree pin belongs to the session, not the
  agent, so two implementers that each entered one would cross-pin: the second
  lands in the first's tree, edits its own files fine, and only discovers it
  cannot commit at the end. Without the pin they run concurrently, in one
  Workflow.
- **Pass 2 confirms the squash landed on `main`** before removing anything. A
  squash-merged branch always looks like it has unmerged commits, which is
  indistinguishable from work that was never merged at all.

**The merge ripple.** Under strict required checks, every merge makes the other
passed PRs `BEHIND`. Pass 1 updates each branch rather than spending a fixer on
it, but each update re-runs CI and delays that handoff by a tick. A merge queue,
or merging the ready PRs in quick succession, avoids the ripple.

## Limits

These exist because the loop runs unattended against a monthly usage cap.

- **6 issues in flight**, counted from open `ai-wip` issues.
- **Reviewers see the diff only** — `gh pr view`, `gh pr diff`, the issue body.
  No repo-wide exploration.
- **2 fix rounds per PR.** On the third `ai-changes`, stop and mark
  `ai-blocked`. Reviewer↔implementer ping-pong is the one unbounded token sink.
- **8 review and fix agents per tick**, in one Workflow; the rest wait for the
  next tick.
- **An idle tick spawns zero agents.**
- **Stall reaping instead of timeouts.** Nothing can time an agent out from
  outside, so a label that has sat 45 minutes without its expected transition is
  reaped — but only when no PR exists, since an agent that opened one has
  already handed off. Every reap comments *why*; a bare `ai-blocked` reads as a
  considered judgement when it was actually a timeout.

## Driving it

```
/ai-loop
```

That's the only thing to type. The loop paces itself: each tick keeps one
recurring job in this session, firing every 10 minutes while agents or reviews
are in flight and every 30 when idle, so a quiet repo costs two ticks an hour.
The job ends with the session and expires after 7 days. Say "stop the loop" to
end it sooner. Don't wrap it in `/loop`.

**Is a tick coming?** Every tick ends with a `Next tick:` line, and the
statusline segment (`npx @rtorcato/repo-ai fix statusline`) shows it:
`🤖 1wip · next 9m` while the loop runs, and nothing once the last tick is over
35 minutes old. `/ai-loop-status`
reports the same.

**Don't want to wait?** Type `/ai-loop` again to tick now, say after merging a PR
or labelling an issue `ai-ready`. It reuses the running schedule rather than
adding a second one.

**Wake on change instead.** A tick is a full LLM turn, so ticking faster costs
more tokens. `loop watch` polls without the LLM: every `pollSeconds` it computes
the tick's work list and prints one line only when the actionable part changes:
the local time, the tick summary, then each non-empty category by PR or issue
number.

```
15:42  5wip·1rev  review #78 · fix #69 · update #74 · handoff #74 · pickup #39 #41 · cleaned #62 · stalled #55
```

The line never carries an issue or PR body. `--json` prints the full structured
work list instead.
The skill runs it through Claude Code's Monitor tool, where each line wakes the
session for a tick, and re-arms it when the Monitor expires at 30 minutes. While
a watcher runs, the fallback wakeup is always 30 minutes.

```bash
npx @rtorcato/repo-ai loop watch
```

A poll costs what a tick's reads cost: a handful of GitHub API calls, plus a
couple per open loop PR. At the default 180 seconds that is 20 polls an hour,
so a repo with a few PRs in flight stays well under the 5,000/h limit. Raise
`pollSeconds` in `.repo-ai.json` if the same token drives other automation. It
can't go below 60. A halt prints once, and a failed poll is skipped. An
`agentUser` mismatch does not halt the watcher; see
[Running reviewers as a second identity](#running-reviewers-as-a-second-identity).

### Watching the loop from GitHub

Labels are the loop's whole state, so GitHub's own search works as a live board.
Nothing to install. Save these as issue or PR searches in the repo:

| View | Search |
|---|---|
| Being implemented | `is:open is:issue label:ai-wip` |
| In agent review | `is:open is:pr label:ai-review` |
| Waiting for you to merge | `is:open is:pr label:merge-ready assignee:@me` |
| Stuck, needs a human | `is:open label:ai-blocked` |
| Queued for an agent | `is:open is:issue label:ai-ready` |

For a board, create a GitHub Project, turn on its built-in *Auto-add* workflow
for this repo, and group the view by label. Columns then follow the loop with no
extra tooling.

Ticks fire only while the REPL is idle. Stop by asking the session to stop the
loop, or just remove the `ai-ready` labels — the loop then idles harmlessly.

On a new repo, start with one trivial `ai-ready` issue and watch the first few
ticks before leaving the loop alone.

## Safety

The `ai-ready` label is the hard gate: on a public repo only collaborators can
apply labels. An author-association check (`OWNER` / `MEMBER` / `COLLABORATOR`)
is the backstop, and the issue body is treated as **untrusted data, never
instructions**. See [Public-Repo Issue Safety](https://rtorcato.github.io/repo-tooling/docs/guides/public-repo-issue-safety)
for the full standard.

GitHub only — the loop is built on `gh` and has no GitLab path.

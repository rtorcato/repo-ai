 * The user-global agent skills this package ships (#404).
 *
 * The only check that reports on state *outside* the repo being audited, which
 * is why it never returns `drift` or `missing`: an out-of-date `~/.claude/skills`
 * is not a defect in this repo, and either of those statuses would fail its CI
 * over a file CI has never seen. `optional-missing` is the honest verdict — an
 * opt-in workflow tool that isn't configured — and it leaves the exit code alone.
 *
 * `skillsDir` is doctor's `--skills-dir`. Without it this reported against
 * `~/.claude/skills` whatever directory the repo actually installs into, so a
 * consumer who passes the flag to `fix` saw a permanent false `optional-missing`
 * for a skill they have (#485).

 * asserting a dependency, so it names the skills the repo actually runs on and

 *
 * Staleness is the failure mode it exists for. Absence fails loudly the moment
 * something reaches for the skill; a copy three releases behind runs to
 * completion without complaint — observed 2026-08-26, an `ai-loop` missing
 * both its decision-comment security gate and its decay rule.

 * machine, not the repo, so it never returns `drift` or `missing`. A contributor
 * with no Claude installed must not fail this repo's `doctor`.
 *
 * **Check and hint only.** The fixer writes into `~/`, and repo config that
 * triggers writes outside the repo is the shape of a supply-chain attack even
 * when the content is benign. doctor says stale; the human runs the fixer.

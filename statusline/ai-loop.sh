# ai-loop statusline segment — shipped by @rtorcato/repo-ai.
# Installed to ~/.claude/ai-loop-statusline.sh by `repo-ai fix statusline`;
# edits there are overwritten on the next run of that fixer.
#
# Prints "🤖 <summary> · next 9m" (or "· manual") — from <repo>/.claude/ai-loop-status, written by
# the ai-loop skill's Pass 5 at the end of every tick — or nothing when
# there is no status or it is stale.

#   ai-loop-statusline.sh [dir]
#
# With no argument it reads Claude Code's statusline JSON on stdin for the
# directory, falling back to $PWD. Call it from an existing statusline script
# with that script's cwd: "$HOME/.claude/ai-loop-statusline.sh" "$cwd"

# The loop ticks at most 30 minutes apart, so older than this means
# the loop has stopped — and a dead loop must not keep claiming work in flight.
